DynamoDB table
=======================================================================================
Terraform uses DynamoDB table (the one you specified: terraform-state-lock) to place a 
lock whenever you run a command (plan, apply, etc.) so that two people (or processes) 
donâ€™t try to update the state at the same time.

- Manually unlock state file with Terraform
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
